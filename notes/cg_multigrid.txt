u0 = zeros

1 pre-smoothing:
 - exactly nails the strong dirichlet
 - residual will have 0 at strong Dirichlet conditions

 - then project down once with L'
 	- don't have 0 at strong Dirichlet anymore

Strategy 1:
 - once projected, re-strong Dirichlet the RHS and the operator

Strategy 2:
 - do nothing after projecting and see if it works

Strategy 3:
 - do weak Dirichlet with a penalty parameter
 - would probably behave like we expect DG to behave
